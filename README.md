# Cunctae

Cunctae is a project that begins by considering us as a unique entity. "Cunctae" originates from Latin and means "all," so when we refer to "cunctae," we encompass all kinds of things. This project emerges as an expression of the humanities in the digital realm ([Digital humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities))

Let us build together our "cunctae."
